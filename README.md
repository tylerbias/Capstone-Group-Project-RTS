Sagitta: Demonstration Instructions

Hosted access URL:

Usage Instructions:
1)IMPORTANT NOTE:​​ If you have visited this hosted game URL before (for example, at
the midpoint project check), you will need to clear your browser’s cache first in order to
load the latest version of the game.

2)Visit the hosted URL linked at the top of this page. Basic instructions will be displayed on
the right side (or bottom, if your browser window is too small) of the screen throughout
the game.

3)After the game loads, a title screen will be displayed. Select ‘AI EASY’ or ‘AI HARD’ and
press the ‘START’ button to begin.

4)You and the AI will each start the game with a castle and 4 peasants. Protect your
castle! Destroying the AI’s castle will cause you to win the game, and if the AI destroys
your castle you will lose the game.

5)You will start as the BLUE player in the bottom right corner of the screen. The AI
opponent is the RED player in the top left of the screen.

6)Left click directly on a unit to select a single unit. Hold left click and drag to create a red
box that will select multiple units when left click is released. To deselect unit(s), simply
left click any area of the map.

7)When a unit or multiple units are selected, a transparent box will be displayed around the
unit(s). Right clicking an area of the map will cause all of your selected units to move
towards that area. Right clicking an enemy troop or building will cause your selected
units to move towards and attack that troop/building.

8)Right clicking a gold mine will cause your selected peasants to move to the gold mine
and begin mining gold (note: only peasants can mine gold). Each mining peasant will
increase your gold per 5 seconds by 2; your current gold will be displayed in the upper
right corner of the game screen.

9)Peasants can build additional buildings at the cost of gold. Build a building by selecting a
peasant, moving him to an open area, and pressing the key on the keyboard for the type
of building you want to build. Note that the building will be built instantly, directly top and
right of the selected peasant. If you do not have enough gold for the building, pressing
the key will have no effect. The available buildings and their associated costs are:
KEY BUILDING TROOPS PRODUCED COST
T Tavern Recruits 100g
B Barracks Knights 150g
R Range Archers 200g
H Horse Stables Cavalry 250g

10)Buildings will produce one troop of the associated type every 10 seconds, up to a
maximum of 8 units of that type present on the map (i.e. if your barracks stops producing
Knights because you already have 8, but one of your Knights dies, a new Knight will be
produced again up to the maximum of 8). Note that the Castle automatically produces
peasants (also 8 maximum, but the AI will be limited to 4 max on the easy setting). Each
additional building of the same type will allow an additional 8 units of that type to be
constructed. For example, if you build two Taverns, you can now have up to 16 Recruits
on the map (8 per Tavern that is currently alive).

11)Construct buildings and use your army to protect your own castle and destroy the AI
opponent’s castle.

12)The game state will be saved automatically every 10 seconds via cookies, allowing you
to reload the page or leave and return later to resume the game with the ‘LOAD SAVED
GAME’ button on the title screen. Note that if you attempt to load the saved game after
you already achieved victory or suffered defeat, a new game will instead be started.
